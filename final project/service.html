                            If there are any other faults in your record player please reach out to us for futher information. Vinyl record players are important to us as it is the source of sound to hear the beautiful records, so allow us to make that possible.

                        <p> This is just one example of our vinyl record restoration. Here is a <strong>before</strong> and <strong>after</strong> of the vinyl record Chico Freeman. As you can see in the first audio, you can hear distortion such as scratching and hissing. 
                            These are one of many things we look out for, as there could be jumping and clicking etc...On the other hand, the second audio was restored and it sounds a lot more clear and pleasing to the ears. We clean our records more than once just to ensure
                            there are zero faults.

                    <h2>Vinyl record player repair tips</h2>
                    <p>Vinyl record players can be complex and require a bit more expertise to repair, but here are some general tips to help you get started:
                        Remember, be careful when repairing record players, as they can be delicate and require precision. Take your time, and don't force anything. With a little patience and care, you can bring your record player back to life.
                        <br><br>
                        <ol>
                        <li>Identify the problem: Determine what the problem is with the record player. Is it a sound issue, or is it not turning on at all? Knowing the problem can help you diagnose the issue more accurately.</li>
                        
                        <li>Check the power source: If the record player isn't turning on, make sure it's plugged in and the power source is working properly.</li>
                        
                        <li>Inspect the belt: If the turntable isn't spinning, the belt may be worn or broken. Check the belt for signs of wear and replace it if necessary.</li>
                        
                        <li>Clean the stylus: If the sound quality is poor or the music skips, the stylus may be dirty or worn. Clean the stylus with a stylus cleaning brush or replace it if necessary.</li>
                        
                        <li>Adjust the tracking force: If the music skips or sounds distorted, the tracking force may need to be adjusted. Consult the owner's manual or a professional to learn how to adjust the tracking force correctly.</li>
                        
                        <li>Lubricate moving parts: If the turntable is making unusual noises, lubricate any moving parts, such as the tonearm or bearings, with a silicone-based lubricant.</li>
                       
                        <li>Get professional help: If you're not comfortable repairing the record player yourself, or if the problem is more complex, contact us here at vinyl revival, a trusted online repair service.</li>

                    <h2>Vinyl record repair tips</h2>
                    <p>Vinyl records can be fragile and prone to damage, but with the right tools and techniques, many common issues can be repaired. Here are some tips for vinyl record repair:
                        Remember to always be gentle with your vinyl records, and if you're not sure how to repair a particular issue, consider taking it to a professional for repair.
                        <br><br>
                        <ol>
                        <li>Clean the record: Before attempting any repairs, make sure the record is clean. Use a record cleaning solution and a soft brush to remove dirt and debris.</li>
                        
                        <li>Flatten warped records: If a record is warped, you can try to flatten it using heat. Place the record between two sheets of glass, and then heat it with a hairdryer or heat gun for a few minutes until it becomes pliable. Remove the heat and let it cool, still sandwiched between the two sheets of glass.</li>
                        
                        <li>Repair scratches: Minor scratches can often be repaired using a vinyl record repair kit, which includes a solution that fills in the scratch and dries to a hard finish. For deeper scratches, you may need to use a specialized machine to buff them out.</li>
                        
                        <li>Fix skips: If a record skips, it could be due to a scratch or groove damage. You can try using a small amount of wood glue to fill in the damaged area, and then gently sand it down to level the surface. Be very careful with this method, and only try it as a last resort.</li>
                        
                        <li>Store properly: Prevention is key. To avoid damage to your records, make sure to store them in a cool, dry place away from direct sunlight. Keep them in their protective sleeves and handle them by the edges.</li>
                        
                        <li>Lubricate moving parts: If the turntable is making unusual noises, lubricate any moving parts, such as the tonearm or bearings, with a silicone-based lubricant.</li>
                       
                        <li>Get professional help: If you're not comfortable repairing the record player yourself, or if the problem is more complex, contact us here at vinyl revival, a trusted online repair service.</li>
